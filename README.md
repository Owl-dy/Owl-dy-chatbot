# My First chatbot project desgined for Marketing Class

--------
## How Did This Project Happened?

It started as a **Business Class Project** --- to come up with an idea of a product to meet un-met demand and create a marketing plan.
Our group wanted to create a marketing plan a frictional Rice University App that integrates all student campus resources in one place. Sent out survey to 200+ students asking what features to include.

**I went beyond the class requirements and attempted to make a real version of such App**

I am a self-starter. Owl-dy was developed all by myself with **absolutely zero App or Web development experience**. 

I learned everything from ground zero, and finished core development and deployed in 10hrs, additional 5hrs on polishing, training NLP (Natural Language Processing) 
--- spending 20 hours on this my first personal project
